<b>Technologies used:</b> HTML5 | CSS3 | JQuery

<b>Here's how the app works:</b>

	* There are four crystal skulls displayed as buttons on the page.

	* You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

	* When you click on a crystal skull, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. 

     * The game will hide this amount until you click a crystal skull.
     * When you click one, it will update your score counter.

	* You win if your total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

	* You lose if your score goes above the random number.

	* The game restarts whenever you win or lose.

	* When the game begins again, you should see a new random number. Also, all the crystal skulls will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

	* The app should show the number of games you win and lose. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
